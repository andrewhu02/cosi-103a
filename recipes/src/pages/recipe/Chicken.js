          <h5 className="subheader">What is halal guys chicken and rice?</h5>
          <p className="recipe-description">
            It’s a famous dish that originated from a street cart in NYC. My husband and I actively sought out the food cart on our honeymoon! The chicken used in the NYC cart is halal (can be consumed by Muslims) so it became a flocking point to Muslim locals, tourists, then basically anyone wanting great street food. The definition of a great street food meal, every component of this dish works together so well.

          <p className="recipe-description">
            The rice is buttery and full of flavor - I think it’s the best rice I’ve cooked at home. The chicken is tender and juicy and full of flavor from the marination, and the white sauce is a creamy and just a little sweet.
